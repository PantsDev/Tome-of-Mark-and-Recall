![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/BPc5jq0.png)

Tome of Mark and Recall is a simple Datapack designed to be used **alongside** the **Vanilla Tweaks Home**, **Spawn**, and **Back** modules.
The first release contains the first page of the tome which will allow you to teleport back to your primary home. You can solely use this release if you only have one home, or if your server operator doesn't allow more than one home set. Further versions will include:

- A page for Marking up to 10 different locations for teleportation
- A page for teleporting back to those specific spots
- A page for quick /back and /spawn as well as a button to list your houses in chat
- Possibly more, suggestions are appreciated, but please keep it within the realm of the specific VT modules mentioned above

### **Usage**
To summon the Tome, all you need to do is either type or copy this trigger command into chat:
```
/trigger summontome
```
<sub>Tome can be summoned as many times as needed with no cooldown.</sub>
